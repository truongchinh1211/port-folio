## FTP Application

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/truongchinh1211/ftp-application)

<div style="text-align: justify">FTP Secure is a unique and secure solution for data transmission between client and server. Built on the Java platform and utilizing the Hibernate framework, this application not only provides a user-friendly interface but also ensures high security.

By employing Socket, the application establishes a robust connection between devices while using symmetric key encryption to safeguard data from unauthorized access. The flexible combination of asymmetric keys ensures that only authenticated partners can connect, thus mitigating security risks effectively.

Through Hibernate, user management becomes both easy and secure, facilitating the efficient maintenance of user information. The integrated file management feature is versatile, supporting convenient upload and download operations while effectively organizing directory structures.

This application excels not only in interacting with databases through Hibernate but also in supporting multiple concurrent connections, enhancing performance and promptly addressing users' multitasking needs. FTP Secure seamlessly blends security, flexibility, and efficiency, making it an excellent choice for safe and effective data transmission.</div>

### fast food store management

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/truongchinh1211/fast-food-store-management)

<div style="text-align: justify">This application, developed in pure Java with Java Swing, serves as a learning project for object-oriented programming and basic database interactions. It features a simple yet effective interface for managing fast-food store data without relying on frameworks. Key aspects include OOP principles, traditional SQL queries for database interaction, and a user-friendly Java Swing interface. This project is designed to help users get acquainted with OOP and the fundamentals of database connectivity in Java.</div>

### Detect Spam Messages: TF-IDF and Naive Bayes Classifier

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](projects/detect-spam-nlp.html)
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/chriskhanhtran/detect-spam-messages-nlp/blob/master/detect-spam-nlp.ipynb)

<div style="text-align: justify">In order to predict whether a message is spam, first I vectorized text messages into a format that machine learning algorithms can understand using Bag-of-Word and TF-IDF. Then I trained a machine learning model to learn to discriminate between normal and spam messages. Finally, with the trained model, I classified unlabel messages into normal or spam.</div>
